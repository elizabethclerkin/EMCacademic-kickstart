I am quantitative researcher with 7 years of experience designing and executing complex research projects. I have a PhD in Psychology, and I am excitedly pursuing a research career in industry. I am relocating the DC Metro Area in July 2022!

Here are some reasons I could be a great addition to your team:
* I am a specialist in creating rich data visualizations that communicate a clear story and actionable insights.
* I am a wiz at analyzing large unstructured datasets as well as experimental design. 
* I am skilled in data collection from human subjects, including mobile eye-tracking which I have done with participants of all ages. 
* I am very comfortable with public speaking, and I have given talks and posters at 9 international research conferences. 
* I have also published articles in top academic journals such as the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and Trends in Cognitive Science.
* I have a strong desire to always keep learning, and my PhD shows that I can devote myself to becoming an expert on a topic.
* I have always led with empathy for my research participants and taken a participant-centered approach. I'm ready to apply this same mindset to solving problems in other contexts!

In my free time, I love to bake and bullet journal. I am also passionate about dance â€” I have been dancing since I was 3!
